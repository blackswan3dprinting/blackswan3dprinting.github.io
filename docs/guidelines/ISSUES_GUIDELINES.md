# Contributer Issue Guidelines

![Black Swan Docs header](/.github/docs_header.png)

Welcome to the Contributer Issue Guidelines. This document is meant to explain how to add an issue to this repository so that the Black Swan developers know what to code.

## What is an Issue?

A GitHub issue can be said to be a "ticket". For example, did you notice there's a bug? You can open an issue. Do you want a feature? Open an issue!

However, issues are only useful if we all understand how to use them. So, let's go over some basics.

## Basic Elements

### Labels

In your issues, please make sure to use features already provided by GitHub. Specifically, use **labels** to specify what type of issue you're opening. Is it a bug? An enhancement? Please be specific!

### Assigned

GitHub Issues has a neat feature that allows us to assign issues. **For now, please only assign issues to Carlos!** If I realize someone else is more fit to handle the issue, I will reassign it. But to reduce complexity, please assign them to me! Thanks!

### Details details details

The title of the issue must be short! However, it must be clear. The description of your issue, however, must be as descriptive as possible. What do you want the feature to do? What page should this feature be on?  How soon should this feature be released? Include as many important details as possible, it'll be beneficial in the long run!

### Be professional

Remember that the GitHub repository is **public**. Anybody can see our comments. Please be professional and respectful towards each other.

## Template

If you'd like to know if you're being specific enough, you can use this template:

```md
**What feature/bug fix would you like?**
[Enter your response here.]

**What page should this feature/bug fix be on?**
[Enter your response here, preferrably a URL.]

**Please specify a deadline for this feature/bug fix to be done.**
[Enter your response here.]
```

## Conclusion

This concludes the GitHub issues guidelines. Please make sure to follow them as much as you can for productivity's sake. Thanks!
