                    <h2>My Story</h2>
                    <p>As far as I can remember, I've always tried to make software easier to understand. Whether it was by trying to make an iPhone easier for my grandma to use or trying to change my day-to-day apps just to experience something different, software was always at the heart of it. It was no surprise that I'd end up studying Informatics as it puts the focus on one person and one person only: the user.</p>
