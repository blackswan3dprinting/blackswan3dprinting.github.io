If you'd like to contribute to the repository, please read the [Issue Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/blackswan3dprinting/blackswan3d.com/blob/main/docs/guidelines/ISSUES_GUIDELINES.md). If you're a developer that needs to look into the design of the website with code samples, look at the [BS3D Design System](https://github.com/blackswan3dprinting/blackswan3d.com/blob/main/docs/design/BS3D_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) document.
