# blackswan3d.com

Welcome to the [blackswan3d.com](https://blackswan3d.com) repository. This document will serve as the documentation for the website in case future developers need to edit the website.

## Software/Tools

The website is built using:

- [Render](https://render.com/)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/)
- HTML, [Sass](https://sass-lang.com), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

## Installation

Here are links to install...

- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/installation/#install-flask) (All the way at the bottom, "Install Flask")
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download)

I'd prefer you get the instructions from their official websites rather than I provide you with instructions that may become outdated at some point.

## Cool tools

- [Sass Cheatsheet](https://quickref.me/sass)
- [HTTP Status Code Cheatsheet](https://quickref.me/http-status-code) (consistency is important)

## What's next?

The more the website grows, the more I'll add to this document. For now, since there's no backend, this is all you need to know.
